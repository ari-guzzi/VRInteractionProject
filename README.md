# VR Interaction Project
## Proposal
It is an interactive puzzle solved by changing rotating mirrors to make a light shine on specific spots.
- Ari Guzzi

### Interaction Description
The interaction will be changing the mirror's position in the space.

1) Pick up the mirror and place it in a different spot.
2) Click a button that rotates the mirror.
3) Slide the mirrors along a track by dragging them with the controller or swiping.

## Final Deliverable
### Core Interactions I Implemented
I created three different ways to rotate a cube.
### Descriptions of Interactions I Implemented
- I made the blue cube rotate by having the user press X.
- I made the green cube rotate by holding it with the right trigger and tracking the controller's movement to spin it.
- I made the purple cube rotate by having the user pick it up by holding A and then pressing Y to rotate it.
### Observations and Reactions
I noticed a lot of my testers needed help with the picking-up interaction. I also realized that because I used so many different buttons, the user was not familiar with each button on the controller and couldn't see it with the goggles on. I also noticed that users usually took an extra second to get the green block to spin with controller movements.
### User Questions and Responses
#### Pre-Test Questions
1) Before we begin, tell me about your previous experience with virtual reality and how often you use VR applications.<br>
    a. At least twice a week<br>
    b. Not very often<br>
    c. Never outside of class<br>
    d. Not frequently, but I have been to a couple of VR arcades<br>
    e. Just class<br>

2) Have you used similar VR interactions before, such as rotating objects or using controllers for navigation? If yes, what types of interactions have you performed?<br>
    a. Used 3D modeling tools in VR<br>
    b. Yes, only one game - pressed the button on the controller to get into the rotate mode and used the joystick.<br>
    c. Yes, in a study<br>
    d. no<br>
    e. no<br>

3) What are your expectations from a VR application regarding ease of use and interaction? What makes a VR experience enjoyable for you?<br>
    a. You should always have controllers, and don't try to 100% copy reality<br>
    b. Having excellent movement, not nauseating, but fun. “Move in ways I can’t in actual real life”<br>
    c. Intuitive, when similar to real-life<br>
    d. Having feedback like vibrations or sound<br>
    e. intuitive, easy to figure out, immersive<br>

#### Post-Test Questions
1) How quickly were you able to understand and perform each interaction type? Did any methods feel slower or more cumbersome than the others?<br>
    a. When knowing which buttons are on the controller, nothing challenging<br>
    b. I liked purple the most, but it felt most difficult. Rotating one is weird, but I found it easier. Look at and tap the easiest<br>
    c. Green and blue were fast. Purple was hard <br>
    d. Relatively quickly, purple was harder<br>
    e. Green, blue, and purple felt easiest to hardest because the amount of buttons needed increased.<br>

2) Which interaction method gave you the most control over the cube's rotation? Did you feel any methods were too sensitive or not responsive enough?<br>
    a. Picking up was rotating in more axis than the others. I would prefer to use a joystick. The trigger rotating wish it was bsed on how much it was pushed down. <br>
    b. Rotate one was really sensitive. I liked the control of picking up the purple one.<br>
    c. The blue one. Purple is not responsive enough, and green is too sensitive<br>
    d. Green felt too sensitive. I like blue and purple.<br>
    e. I liked the purple one because it would reflect hand movement. Green felt too sensitive - and I wanted an amount of trigger for speed.<br>

3) If this were a puzzle game in which you rotated the pieces to solve the puzzle, which interaction would you recommend?<br>
    a. Liked purple, but recommends picking up with one hand and pass off to either hand<br>
    b. Purple, unless it's static, in which Blue<br>
    c. Blue<br>
    d. purple<br>
    e. Blue <br>
